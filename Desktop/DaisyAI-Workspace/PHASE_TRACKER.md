# **DaisyAI Phase Execution Tracker**

## **üö® CRITICAL: GOVERNANCE & COMPLIANCE SUMMARY**

This document tracks the execution of the DaisyAI ecosystem buildout. All activities MUST adhere to the standards defined in the MASTER\_ARCHITECTURE.md, including:

* **ASP 0.5.2 Compliance**: Use of official templates and commands.  
* **Structure**: A mono-repo with root-level agent directories and a centralized /terraform directory.  
* **Naming Convention**: Underscores \_ for directories, hyphens \- for A2A service names.  
* **IaC Workflow**: The centralized, automated CI/CD pipeline triggered by a Git commit is the mandatory deployment method.

### **Phase A: One-Time Workspace & IaC Setup**

**Status**: \[x\] COMPLETED ‚úÖ

* \[x\] **GitHub Repo Created**: DaisyAI-Workspace mono-repo is established.  
* \[x\] **GCP Projects Created**: daisy-ai-staging and daisy-ai-production are active with billing enabled.  
* \[x\] **Cloud Build Connection Created**: A single connection from the CI/CD GCP project to the DaisyAI-Workspace GitHub repo is established.  
* \[x\] **Centralized IaC Scaffolding**: The root /terraform and /deployment directories are created and configured.  
* \[x\] **Initial IaC Deployment**: terraform apply has been run to create foundational resources.

## **Current Phase: Phase 1 \- Foundation Infrastructure**

**Objective**: Onboard the first three foundation agents (daisy\_knowledge, daisy\_maestro, daisy\_talent) using the definitive "Golden Path" workflow.

### **Phase 1 Checklist**

#### **üéµ Onboarding daisy\_knowledge**

**Status**: \[x\] CREATED & CONFIGURED ‚úÖ | \[ \] DEPLOYMENT REMEDIATION IN PROGRESS

* \[x\] **Step 1: Create Agent**:  
  * \[x\] Ran: agent-starter-pack create daisy\_knowledge with agentic\_rag template.  
  * \[x\] **CRITICAL**: Deleted the auto-generated daisy\_knowledge/deployment/ directory.  
* \[x\] **Step 2: Local Validation & Testing**:  
  * \[x\] cd daisy\_knowledge/  
  * \[x\] make install (212 packages installed).  
  * \[x\] make lint and make test-unit passed.  
  * \[x\] make playground (ADK Web UI launched successfully).  
* \[x\] **Step 3: Agent Customization**:  
  * \[x\] Updated agent.py and organized tools into app/tools/.  
* \[x\] **Step 4: Register Agent in IaC**:  
  * \[x\] Updated central terraform/vars/agents.tfvars with the daisy\_knowledge configuration.  
* \[x\] **Step 5: Git Workflow**:  
  * \[x\] All changes have been committed and pushed to the main branch.  
* \[ \] **Step 6: Coordinated Deployment & Verification**:  
  * \[ \] **NEXT STEP**: Resolve Agent Engine deployment configuration issue.  
  * \[ \] Trigger a new deployment via a fresh PR merge.  
  * \[ \] Verify the agent is running in the **Vertex AI Agent Engine console**.

#### **üéØ Onboarding daisy\_maestro**
