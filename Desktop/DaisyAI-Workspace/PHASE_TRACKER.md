# **DaisyAI Phase Execution Tracker**

## **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: GOVERNANCE & COMPLIANCE SUMMARY**

This document tracks the execution of the DaisyAI ecosystem buildout. All activities MUST adhere to the standards defined in the MASTER_PLAN.md, including:

* **ASP 0.5.2 Compliance**: Use of official templates and commands.  
* **Structure**: A mono-repo with root-level agent directories and a centralized /terraform directory.  
* **Naming Convention**: Underscores _ for directories, hyphens - for A2A service names.  
* **IaC Workflow**: The centralized, automated CI/CD pipeline triggered by a Git commit is the mandatory deployment method.

### **Phase A: One-Time Workspace & IaC Setup**

**Status**: [x] COMPLETED âœ…

* [x] **GitHub Repo Created**: DaisyAI-Workspace mono-repo is established.  
* [x] **GCP Projects Created**: daisy-ai-staging and daisy-ai-production are active with billing enabled.  
* [x] **Cloud Build Connection Created**: A single connection from the CI/CD GCP project to the DaisyAI-Workspace GitHub repo is established.  
* [x] **Centralized IaC Scaffolding**: The root /terraform and /deployment directories are created and configured.  
* [x] **Initial IaC Deployment**: terraform apply has been run to create foundational resources.

## **Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation Infrastructure**

**Objective**: Migrate existing agents to centralized CI/CD and deploy using the definitive "Golden Path" workflow.

### **Phase 1 Migration & Deployment Checklist**

#### **ðŸ”„ MIGRATION COMPLETED - All Existing Agents**

**Status**: [x] COMPLETED âœ…

* [x] **Directory Naming Compliance**: 
  * [x] Renamed daisy-knowledge â†’ daisy_knowledge
  * [x] Renamed daisy-maestro â†’ daisy_maestro  
  * [x] Renamed daisy-talent â†’ daisy_talent
* [x] **Centralized IaC Registration**:
  * [x] Updated terraform/vars/agents.tfvars with all 3 agents
  * [x] All agents properly configured with correct templates and ports
* [x] **Container Preparation**:
  * [x] Created Dockerfile for daisy_maestro
  * [x] Created Dockerfile for daisy_talent
  * [x] Verified Dockerfile for daisy_knowledge
* [x] **Cleanup Agent-Specific Deployment**:
  * [x] Removed daisy_maestro/deployment/ directory
  * [x] Removed daisy_talent/deployment/ directory
* [x] **Terraform Validation**: 
  * [x] terraform plan executed successfully
  * [x] All 23 resources ready for creation (service accounts, IAM, Cloud Run, Vertex AI endpoints, triggers)

#### **ðŸš€ READY FOR CI/CD DEPLOYMENT**

**Status**: [ ] PENDING COMMIT & PUSH

* [ ] **Step 1: Git Commit**:  
  * [ ] **NEXT STEP**: Commit all migration changes to Git
  * [ ] Staging: daisy_knowledge, daisy_maestro, daisy_talent
  * [ ] Infrastructure: Updated agents.tfvars, new Dockerfiles
* [ ] **Step 2: Push to GitHub**:  
  * [ ] Push changes to trigger centralized Cloud Build pipeline
* [ ] **Step 3: Monitor CI/CD Pipeline**:  
  * [ ] Monitor Cloud Build console for automated deployment
  * [ ] Verify Terraform apply creates all 23 resources
  * [ ] Verify Docker image builds for all 3 agents
  * [ ] Verify Cloud Run deployments succeed
* [ ] **Step 4: Verify Deployed Agents**:  
  * [ ] Test daisy_knowledge in Cloud Run console
  * [ ] Test daisy_maestro in Cloud Run console  
  * [ ] Test daisy_talent in Cloud Run console

#### **ðŸ“Š Agent Status Overview**

| Agent | Directory | IaC Status | Dockerfile | Deployment Status |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| daisy_knowledge | âœ… daisy_knowledge/ | âœ… Registered | âœ… Exists | ðŸ”„ Ready for CI/CD |
| daisy_maestro | âœ… daisy_maestro/ | âœ… Registered | âœ… Created | ðŸ”„ Ready for CI/CD |
| daisy_talent | âœ… daisy_talent/ | âœ… Registered | âœ… Created | ðŸ”„ Ready for CI/CD |

## **Upcoming Phases**

* **Phase 2 - Music Business Core**: Onboard daisy_production, daisy_marketing, daisy_live.  
* **Phase 3 - Business Operations**: Onboard daisy_venue, daisy_rights, daisy_legal, daisy_financial, daisy_audience.  
* **Phase 4 - Production Hardening**: Implement full observability stack, security audits, and comprehensive load testing.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Next Immediate Steps**

1. **âœ… MIGRATION COMPLETE**: All existing agents successfully migrated to centralized CI/CD system
2. **ðŸš€ COMMIT & DEPLOY**: Commit changes and push to GitHub to trigger automated deployment
3. **ðŸ“Š VERIFY DEPLOYMENT**: Monitor CI/CD pipeline and verify all 3 agents deploy successfully
4. **ðŸŽµ BEGIN PHASE 2**: Start onboarding next batch of agents (daisy_production, daisy_marketing, daisy_live)
5. **ðŸ”— IMPLEMENT A2A**: Begin testing Agent-to-Agent communication between deployed agents
