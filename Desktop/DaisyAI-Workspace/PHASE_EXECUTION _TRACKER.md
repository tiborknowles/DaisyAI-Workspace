# **DaisyAI Phase Execution Tracker**

## **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: GOVERNANCE & COMPLIANCE SUMMARY**

This document tracks the execution of the DaisyAI ecosystem buildout. All activities MUST adhere to the standards defined in the MASTER\_PLAN.md, including:

* **ASP 0.5.2 Compliance**: Use of official templates and commands.  
* **Structure**: A mono-repo with root-level agent directories and a centralized /terraform directory.  
* **Naming Convention**: Underscores \_ for directories, hyphens \- for A2A service names.  
* **IaC Workflow**: The centralized, manual Terraform process is mandatory for CI/CD setup.

### **Phase A: One-Time Workspace & IaC Setup**

**Status**: [x] COMPLETED âœ…

* [x] **GitHub Repo Created**: DaisyAI-Workspace mono-repo is established.  
* [x] **GCP Projects Created**: daisy-ai-staging is active with billing enabled.  
* [x] **Vertex AI Authentication**: Service account created and API access verified.  
* [x] **Centralized IaC Scaffolding**:  
  * [x] Create the root /terraform directory.  
  * [x] Populate terraform/variables.tf with all necessary variable definitions.  
  * [x] Create terraform/vars/staging.tfvars and production.tfvars with environment-specific values.  
  * [x] Create terraform/vars/agents.tfvars with daisy_knowledge agent configuration.  
  * [x] Create the main Terraform logic (main.tf) using for\_each loops based on var.agents.  
  * [x] Create deployment/cloudbuild.yaml for mono-repo aware CI/CD pipeline.
* [x] **Initial IaC Setup**:  
  * [x] cd terraform/  
  * [x] terraform init (completed successfully)
  * [x] terraform plan verified (infrastructure ready for deployment)

## **Current Phase: Phase 1 \- Foundation Infrastructure**

**Objective**: Onboard the first two agents (daisy\_knowledge, daisy\_maestro) using the definitive "Golden Path" workflow.

### **Phase 1 Checklist**

#### **ðŸŽ¯ Onboarding daisy\_maestro**

**Status**: [ ] Not Started

* [ ] **Step 1: Create Agent**: agent-starter-pack create daisy\_maestro with orchestration template
* [ ] **Step 2: Local Validation**: cd daisy\_maestro/, make install, make playground.  
* [ ] **Step 3: Register Agent in IaC**: Add daisy\_maestro to the terraform/vars/agents.tfvars file.  
* [ ] **Step 4: Commit & Create Pull Request**.  
* [ ] **Step 5: Coordinated Deployment & Verification**.

## **âœ… Completed Milestones**

1. **Infrastructure Foundation**: Terraform configuration complete
2. **Authentication**: Vertex AI API access verified  
3. **First Agent**: DaisyAI Knowledge agent created and customized
4. **Specialization**: Music industry-specific tools implemented
5. **Local Testing**: Agent playground operational

## **ðŸŽ¯ Next Immediate Steps**

1. Commit current progress and create PR
2. Deploy daisy_knowledge to staging environment  
3. Verify deployed agent functionality
