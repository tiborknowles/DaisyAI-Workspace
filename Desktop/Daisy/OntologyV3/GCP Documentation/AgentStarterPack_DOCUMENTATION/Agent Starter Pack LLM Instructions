AGENT STARTER PACK CODE STRUCTURE GUIDE FOR LLM
Based on the official Agent Starter Pack repository, here's the complete guide:
Official Agent Starter Pack Architecture
The Agent Starter Pack follows this exact structure for each agent:

Standard Commands Per Official Documentation
According to the Getting Started Guide, each agent supports:
make install - Install dependencies using uv sync
make playground - Launch interactive testing environment
make backend - Deploy to Google Cloud (Agent Engine/Cloud Run)
make test - Run unit and integration tests
Deployment Targets Supported
From the official repository:
Agent Engine (agent_engine) - Fully managed solution (recommended)
Cloud Run (cloud_run) - Containerized deployment
Available Templates
Official templates from the repository:
adk_base - Base ReAct agent using Google's ADK
agentic_rag - RAG agent with Vertex AI Search/Vector Search
langgraph_base_react - LangGraph-based ReAct agent
crewai_coding_crew - Multi-agent CrewAI system
live_api - Real-time multimodal RAG agent

Agent Starter Pack Native Testing Tools
Based on my comprehensive review of the Agent Starter Pack documentation, here are the native testing tools provided:
1. 🏗️ Core Testing Commands (Makefile)
Apply
Run
)
2. 🔬 Unit Testing Framework
Framework: pytest
Location: tests/unit/
Purpose: Test business logic, agent functionality, data processing
Example: tests/unit/test_dummy.py (placeholder for your tests)
3. 🔗 Integration Testing
Framework: pytest with ADK integration
Location: tests/integration/
Key Tests:
test_agent.py - Tests agent streaming responses using ADK Runner
test_agent_engine_app.py - Tests Agent Engine deployment integration
Features:
Mocking of dependencies (like retrieve_docs)
Testing with InMemorySessionService
Streaming response validation
4. ⚡ Load Testing Framework
Framework: Locust
Location: tests/load_test/
Purpose: Performance testing of deployed agents
Features:
Simulates concurrent users
Tests Agent Engine streaming endpoints
Generates performance reports (HTML + CSV)
OAuth token-based authentication
5. 📊 Interactive Testing Notebooks
Location: notebooks/
Key Testing Notebooks:
adk_app_testing.ipynb - Comprehensive testing guide for both local and remote agents
evaluating_adk_agent.ipynb - Agent evaluation and performance assessment
intro_agent_engine.ipynb - Agent Engine deployment testing
6. 🎮 Playground Testing Environment
Tool: ADK Web UI (make playground)
Features:
Interactive chat interface
Real-time code reloading
Session management
User feedback collection
Multiple input types support
Chat history tracking
7. 📈 Observability & Monitoring Tools
OpenTelemetry Integration: Automatic tracing and logging
Cloud Trace: Request flow analysis
BigQuery Integration: Long-term data storage
Looker Studio Dashboards: Performance visualization
Custom Logging: Enhanced payload handling for large data
8. 🚀 Deployment Testing
Agent Engine Testing: Remote testing with reasoning engines
Cloud Run Testing: HTTP endpoint testing with authentication
Local vs Remote: Both environments supported in notebooks
🎯 Recommended Testing Workflow
Local Development: Use make playground for interactive testing
Unit Testing: Write tests in tests/unit/ and run with make test
Integration Testing: Test agent functionality with ADK Runner
Load Testing: Deploy with make backend, then run Locust tests
Evaluation: Use Jupyter notebooks for comprehensive evaluation
Production Monitoring: Leverage observability tools for ongoing monitoring
The Agent Starter Pack provides a complete testing ecosystem that covers everything from interactive development to production performance monitoring, all following Google Cloud best practices.
